<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Rabin Chalise. </p>

<p>I am quite excited to resume the web development project after a long halt. I always found it interesting to create websites from scratch and know that it could be observed from any part of the world through internet. Amazing!!</p>

<p>I want to work remotely on web development and travel the world and enjoy life alongside work.</p>
