<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Rabin Chalise. </p>

<p>I am quite excited to resume the web development project after a long halt. I always found it interesting to create websites from scratch and know that it could be observed from any part of the world through internet. Amazing!!</p>

<p>I want to help the world by gaining skills for web development and using it in the service of mankind and easing lives of people.</p>
